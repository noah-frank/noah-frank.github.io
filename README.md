## Experience

### Giti Tire - Data Analyst
<b>May 2023 - Present</b>
Worked as a data analyst that brought actionable insights to the organization in the forms of KPIs, scrap material reports, quality assurance, and tire tracking system. 

| Project                        | Details |
| ------------------------------ | ------- |
| **Key Performance Indexes (KPIs)** | • Created, maintained, and scheduled KPIs to be sent out on a daily and monthly basis<br>• Delivered insights for department managers and plant executives to take action in manufacturing processes |
| **Scrap material reporting**      | • Created scrap reports to assist department leaders and the quality assurance team in pinpointing inefficiencies in production<br>• Tracked areas where scrap was overproduced to minimize wasted materials |
| **Quality assurance reporting**  | • Created multiple reports to assist the quality assurance department in managing holds |
| **Tire tracking database management** | • Created and maintained a database of over 34 million scanner records<br>• Aggregated data from over 15 database tables<br>Utilized SQL jobs to insert data on a regular basis |
| **Item inventory program**       | • Created a program for documenting item storage<br>• Used data generated from the program to create a demand forecast |

## Personal Projects

| Project                        | Details |
| ------------------------------ | ------- |
| [Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Neural Networks](https://github.com/noah-frank/noah-frank.github.io/blob/main/Notebooks/credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb) | • Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset<br>• Oversampled data for equal data representation<br>• Achieved high accuracy, precision, and recall with neural networks |
| [Bank Fraud Detection](https://github.com/noah-frank/portfolio/blob/main/Notebooks/Bank_Fraud_Detection.ipynb) | • Explored and preprocessed a large financial transactions dataset to identify patterns and correlations relevant to fraud detection.<br>• Engineered features and removed identifiers to improve model generalization and prevent data leakage.<br>• Developed machine learning models to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate based on numeric and categorical features.<br>• Applied data analysis techniques to understand transaction behavior and highlight risk factors for banking fraud. |
| [Optimizing Machine Learning Models](https://github.com/noah-frank/portfolio/blob/main/Notebooks/Optimizing_ML_Models.ipynb) | • Preprocessed customer purchase behavior data by handling categorical features with one-hot encoding and standardizing column names.<br>• Built and evaluated multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to establish baseline predictive performance.<br>• Applied feature selection techniques to optimize models and assess the impact on classification accuracy.<br>• Managed end-to-end ML pipeline, from data cleaning to model comparison, using Scikit-learn. |
| [Loan Risk Analysis and Prediction](https://github.com/noah-frank/noah-frank.github.io/blob/main/Notebooks/Loan_Approval_Risk.ipynb) | • Performed exploratory data analysis on a loan approval dataset, identifying key patterns across numeric, categorical, and binary features.<br>• Engineered and preprocessed features using techniques like scaling (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler) and one-hot encoding for optimal model performance.<br>• Developed and trained a deep learning regression model using TensorFlow/Keras to predict borrower risk scores. <br>• Utilized data visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib) to uncover correlations between financial metrics and loan approval risk.<br>• Downloaded and managed external datasets programmatically via KaggleHub API, showcasing data pipeline automation skills. |
